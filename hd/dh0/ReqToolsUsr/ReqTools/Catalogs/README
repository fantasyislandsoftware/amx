(ReqToolsDev.lha).

                                     ----

A partially translated .ct file is included for each of the unsupported
languages. This file may contain (many) errors! Check it carefully! It was
constructed with help from the Workbench 2.1 system catalog files. If you'd
like to translate the rest of the catalog for these languages please note
that a simple translation will not do.

All ReqTools requesters and the ReqTools preference editor adjust
themselves to the width of translated strings. So after you've translated
these catalogs please try all requesters and the preference editor and see
if they look ok. You must also be careful when you pick the keyboard
shortcuts, so you don't use the same key twice.

Also read the comments in the catalog file carefully. They sometimes give
directions to follow (like the following two strings *must* be of the same
width).

Take a look at the install script as well. This is not essential, but it is
always nice if a user can install something in his/her own language.

Please send me your translated catalog file (.ct file) so I can compile it
and include it with the next release of ReqTools. Improved catalogs are
also welcome, as are translated or improved install scripts.
